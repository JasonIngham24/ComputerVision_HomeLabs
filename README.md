# Computer Vision Home Lab

This repository showcases my computer vision home lab projects, which are a collection of hands-on experiments, practicals, and write-ups I've built to explore computer vision concepts. Everything here involves image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and other visual computing techniques using Python and popular libraries like OpenCV and NumPy.
